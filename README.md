TensorFlow Summit Extended KL 2017 - Keras Talk
===============================================

Materials for **TensorFlow is Hard, Keras is Not** talk during the TensorFlow Summit Extended KL event at iTrain on 18th February 2017.

The talk was to introduce Keras - an easy-to-use high level neural network API library, for you to use on top of TensorFlow.
